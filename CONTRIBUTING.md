# Contributing to Style Guide

So you want to contribute your changes back to WPILib. Great! We have a few contributing rules that will help you make sure your changes will be accepted into the project. Please remember to follow the rules written here, and behave with Gracious Professionalism.

- [Submitting Changes](#submitting-changes)
    - [Pull Request Format](#pull-request-format)
- [Licensing](#licensing)

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Format

Changes should be submitted as a Pull Request against the master branch of styleguide. For most changes, we ask that you squash your changes down to a single commit. For particularly large changes, multiple commits are ok, but assume one commit unless asked otherwise. No change will be merged unless it is up to date with the current master. We will also not merge any changes with merge commits in them; please rebase off of master before submitting a pull request. We do this to make sure that the git history isn't too cluttered.

## Licensing

By contributing to this repository, you agree that your code will be licensed under the license for the WPILib project. You should not contribute code that you do not have permission to relicense in this manner. This includes code that is licensed under the GPL that you do not have permission to relicense, as WPILib is not released under a copyleft license. Our license is the 3-clause BSD license, which you can find [here](license.txt).
